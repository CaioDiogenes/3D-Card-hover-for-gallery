# Usage

Selector usage is:
```<lib-figure-card [imgs]="imgs"></lib-figure-card>```
and you need to pass your "img" input array as the follow example:

```
imgs = [
    // okarun
    {
      object3D: "https://i.imgur.com/vWa25XP.gif",
      title: "https://tamashiiweb.com/images/category/664613f57fe0f.png",
      cover: "https://4kwallpapers.com/images/walls/thumbs_2t/19423.jpg",
      redirect: "https://imgur.com/a/6L5s8Z1"
    },

    // ash
